!Example gophermap for GopherXTreme
##
## This is a sample gophermap.
##
Creating a file called "gophermap" in a directory disables the normal 
resource listing and replaces it with the contents of the map file. 
GopherXTreme implements a gophermap format mostly similar to
gophernicus. This example map is based on the gophernicus example.


!The Format
In a gophermap any line that doesn't contain a <TAB> character is 
automatically converted to an type "i" gopher resource which are
displayed as plain text in the client. These lines should be at most
70 characters in width.
..................................70..................................

Lines which contain tabs are intepreted as other varieties of gopher
resource lines which the client will render as links.

The format of a gophermap resource line is simple:
Xname<TAB>selector<TAB>host<TAB>port

Where:
   X          is the gopher filetype
   name       is the display string for the resource
   selector   is the absolute path to the resource
   host       is the hostname holding the resource
   port       is the port the service is reachable on

Type, name and selector are mandatory. 

If you don't specify host or port the host and port of the current 
server are used instead.
